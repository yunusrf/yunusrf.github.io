Developed a robust machine learning and deep learning pipeline for wind speed forecasting at multiple Saudi Arabian sites, supporting renewable energy system planning and optimization.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- **Data Engineering & Automation:** Automated data cleaning, imputation, and dataset creation for time series forecasting (CSV/ARFF formats)
- **ML & DL Modeling:** Implemented and tuned statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models (k-NN, RF, SVR, ARIMA, Holt-Winter, CNN, MLP) for univariate and multivariate forecasting
- **Model Optimization:** Applied batch learning and hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search) for optimal prediction accuracy
- **Visualization & Reporting:** Created insightful visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks and authored technical reports/manuscripts
- **End-to-End Workflow:** Delivered a reproducible, scalable solution from data analysis to model deployment
