Developed a machine learning pipeline for forecasting Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in the Saudi Arabian Gulf using ten years of MODIS satellite data and advanced time series modeling. Automated remote sensing data acquisition, preprocessing, and model training for environmental analytics.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- **Remote Sensing Data Automation:** Engineered automated modules to download and preprocess MODIS satellite data (Chl-a and 9+ parameters) from NASA OceanColor
- **ML & DL Modeling:** Built and tuned statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models (SVR, Bagging, RF, XGBoost, RNN, LSTM, k-NN, ARIMA, Holt-Winter) for univariate and multivariate forecasting
- **Geospatial Data Processing:** Leveraged Python geoscientific libraries (Salem) for spatial data handling and visualization
- **End-to-End Workflow:** Delivered a reproducible pipeline from data acquisition to model deployment and reporting
- **Technical Communication:** Authored technical reports and academic manuscripts documenting methodologies and findings
