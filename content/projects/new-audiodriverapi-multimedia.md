Designed and implemented a new Audio Driver API for the Symbian Multimedia Framework (MMF), enabling enhanced hardware features, improved buffer transfer, and future-proofed multimedia subsystem architecture.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- **API & Framework Engineering:** Analyzed, designed, and implemented new Audio Driver API and user-side interface classes for MMF
- **Performance Optimization:** Leveraged RChunk (kernel-level object) for high-speed buffer transfer between hardware and MMF
- **Design & Documentation:** Authored detailed design docs, use-cases, UML diagrams, and sample code for API integration
- **Testing & Integration:** Developed unit tests, coordinated integration, and managed configuration branches
- **Collaboration & Delivery:** Worked closely with integration teams and maintained technical documentation for ongoing enhancements
