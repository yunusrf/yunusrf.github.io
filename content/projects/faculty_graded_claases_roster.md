Led the migration and enhancement of faculty services at KFUPM by architecting and developing a Faculty Portal module to fetch graded class rosters, identify students with D/DN grades, and generate periodic academic standing reports. The project addressed the end-of-life of Ellucian Banner-8 SSB by integrating legacy Banner APIs into a modern Python/Django platform, delivering secure web forms, advanced pagination, and analytical dashboards.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- **Database Modeling:** Designed and implemented robust Django ORM models for managing student academic data in PostgreSQL 15.x.
- **API Integration:** Integrated Ellucian Banner APIs for real-time faculty and class roster data retrieval using Django REST Framework.
- **Service Migration:** Developed new backend services and ensured seamless integration with existing Python/Django codebase for smooth migration from Banner SSB.
- **User Interface:** Built responsive web interfaces with Django MVT, HTML, Bootstrap, and jQuery, featuring pagination and data filtering.
- **Admin Customization:** Enhanced Django Admin for faculty to view and print student rosters with D/DN grades.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Designed and implemented key reports and dashboards using Tableau for academic analysis.
- **Documentation:** Produced technical design documents, flow diagrams, and detailed specifications for application and reporting modules.
- **DevOps:** Applied best practices in version control (Git) and CI/CD strategies.
