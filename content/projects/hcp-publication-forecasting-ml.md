Developed a machine learning system to forecast high-impact academic publications using advanced bibliometric analysis, feature engineering, and ensemble modeling. Automated data extraction, processing, and model validation workflows for robust, scalable research analytics.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- **Data Engineering & Automation:** Automated extraction and processing of bibliometric data (27+ features) from Web of Science using Python and R
- **Feature Engineering & ML Modeling:** Built and tuned supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, MLP, Na√Øve Bayes, Model Fusion, LSTM) for high-impact paper prediction
- **Model Validation & App Development:** Developed Gradio app for model verification and interactive validation
- **Visualization & Reporting:** Created insightful data visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks and automated reporting with xlsxwriter
- **End-to-End Workflow:** Delivered a reproducible, scalable pipeline from data collection to model deployment and reporting
