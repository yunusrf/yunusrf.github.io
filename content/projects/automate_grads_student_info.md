Architected and developed an automated web application to streamline the Graduating Student Information process at KFUPM, supporting the transition from Ellucian Banner-8 to Banner-9. The system enables students to submit forms, upload documents, edit submissions until deadlines, and generate print previews. Custom admin modules and periodic reports were implemented to monitor student progress, with integrated notifications for both students and administrators to ensure seamless communication.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- **Database Design & Development:** Developed a robust schema using Django ORM for managing graduating student information and optimized PostgreSQL queries for performance.
- **API Integration:** Integrated Banner APIs for secure student data retrieval and updates via Django REST Framework, including middleware for external system communication.
- **Web Application Development:** Built dynamic, user-friendly forms and interfaces using Django MTV, Bootstrap, and jQuery, with real-time validation and secure data submission.
- **Notification System:** Automated email and in-app notifications for form submissions and updates using Djangoâ€™s Email API and Celery.
- **Custom Admin Features:** Enhanced Django admin for data preview, printing, and advanced search/filtering of student records.
- **Reporting & Visualization:** Developed dashboards and automated reports using Tableau, Matplotlib, openpyxl, and xlsxwriter.
- **Documentation:** Produced comprehensive design documents, technical specifications, and user guides for the application and reporting modules.
