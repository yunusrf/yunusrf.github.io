A comprehensive Django-based web application that revolutionizes library fee and fine payments through secure online transactions. Built for KFUPM's library system, this solution streamlines the payment process for thousands of students and faculty members.

The system features seamless integration with MEDAD Library Services Platform APIs for real-time fee retrieval and KFUPM ePay APIs for secure payment processing. Key highlights include automated transaction reconciliation, comprehensive admin dashboards with Tableau analytics, OAuth2 authentication, CSRF protection, and asynchronous payment processing using Celery for optimal performance.

Developed with modern web technologies including PostgreSQL database optimization, Docker containerization, and extensive testing coverage using pytest and Selenium. The application significantly reduced manual payment processing time and improved user experience across the university campus.
